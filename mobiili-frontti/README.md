# Frontend for Älyä hanke project Arvolaskuri

## About the project

The purpose of the project is to promote circular economy in furniture by leveraging artificial intelligence and smart automation.

The goal is to develop circular economy service and process innovations utilizing artificial intelligence and smart automation to meet the needs of various organizations, and to pilot them in selected service channels and environments as well as in the background processes of services.

Artificial intelligence solutions are utilized to enhance customer experience in services related to the sale, brokerage, leasing, restoration, and repair of furniture and the materials used in them, as well as to streamline the background processes of these services. The solutions aim primarily to preserve the value of furniture and the materials used in them for as long as possible throughout the product lifecycle.

"Arvolaskuri" is one part of the Älyä-hankke project, offering a simple yet powerful solution for selling or repairing your old furniture. With just a photo, it tells you the price to sell for of old furniture, its chances of selling, and even gives tips on repair or recycling. It's our humble way of making furniture management easier and more sustainable for everyone.
